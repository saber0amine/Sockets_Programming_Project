Networking Project: Client-Routers-Server Communication .

This project demonstrates client-server communication and includes a router implementation using sockets in the C programming language. It enables communication between multiple clients and a server, as well as routing messages between different networks using routers.

Features
Client-server communication using TCP/IP sockets.
Sending and receiving data between the server and clients.
Concurrent handling of multiple client connections using threading or forking.
Implementation of routers to route messages between different networks.
Customizable routing protocols for dynamic routing.
Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/networking-project.git
Compile the server, client, and router programs:


cd networking-project
gcc server.c -o server
gcc client.c -o client
gcc router.c -o router
Run the server program:

./server
Open a new terminal and run the client program:


./client
You can run multiple instances of the client program to simulate multiple clients connecting to the server.

Open another terminal and run the router program:


./router
Customize the router configuration and routing protocols in the source code file router.c to suit your networking requirements.

Usage
Once the server, client, and router programs are running, you can use the client program to send and receive messages to/from the server. The server will handle these messages and distribute them to the appropriate clients.

The router program will route messages between different networks based on the configured routing protocols. You can customize the routing algorithms and protocols to meet your specific networking needs.

Feel free to explore and modify the source code files server.c, client.c, and router.c to add new functionalities or experiment with different networking scenarios.
