# Sockets Programming Project

This project demonstrates client-Routers-server communication using sockets in the C programming language.

## Description

The project aims to showcase the basics of socket programming and how to establish communication between a client and a server. The client and server applications are implemented in C, allowing them to exchange data over the network using TCP/IP.

## Features

- **Client:** The client application establishes a connection with the server and sends requests or data.
- **Server:** The server application listens for incoming client connections, processes requests, and sends back responses.
- **Socket Programming:** The project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of socket programming, including socket creation, connection establishment, sending and receiving data.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following:

- C Compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Operating System supporting socket programming (e.g., Linux, macOS, Windows)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sockets_Programming_Project.git
